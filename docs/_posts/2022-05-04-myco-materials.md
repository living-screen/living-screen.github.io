title: "Using Computational Design for Myco-materials"
categories: examples
---

Research from The University of Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning has recently been published at the CAADRIA conference. This work outlines how computational design can be used to investigate the capability of myco-materials to grow into detailed forms. 

Myco materials are made from some species of funghi, such as oyster mushrooms you can find at a supermarket or reishi mushrooms that have been used for medicianal purposes for thousands of years. The roots of these mushrooms bind material together as they grow, such a fallen tree or pile of leaves in the wild. Researchers used the mushroom to grow designs using sawdust as a growth material, and were able to construct detailed forms as thin as 3mm. 

So what's the big deal? These materials can be used to take waste sawdust, or even cardboard and paper waste, and turn them into new things, using the energy inside the material to re-manufacture waste into something new. The goal is reducing waste, creating new kinds of sustainable materials and market opportunities.
